        <i>THE STORY</i><br/><br />

        Bombay Sweet Shop is a new celebratory venture by Hunger Inc., the
        company behind The Bombay Canteen and O Pedro. The timely launch marks
        the five year anniversary of Hunger Inc. and fittingly puts the
        spotlight on the sweets that shaped all our happy occasions. However,
        it's not mithai as we know it.<br/><br />

        Staying true to their ethos of 'Re-creation', the thought that has
        driven The Bombay Canteen and also shaped O Pedro, the company looked at
        Indian sweets and the tradition of gifting sweets through a new lens of
        play. The team scoured India, gathering knowledge, recipes and imbibing
        techniques from the masters.<br/><br />

        At the sweet shop, our chefs turned these traditions on their head to
        create sweets that may look and sound familiar but prompt surprise and
        wonder through both presentation and flavours.
